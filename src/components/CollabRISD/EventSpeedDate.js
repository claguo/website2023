            <p>We received overwhelmingly positive feedback for this event as attendees successfully connected with students from other majors. Although it was only a mock event, one attendee even expressed that bouncing ideas off of the other attendees helped her with a project she was currently working on.</p>
            <p>We noticed that the logistics of the event needed heavy improvement. The timing, organization, and the process of pairing attendees and switching partners was messy, inefficient, and rushed.</p>
